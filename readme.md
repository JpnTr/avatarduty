Background
----------
I wanted to explore the Phaser.io game framework, so this was an experiment that was both a technical/learning challenge as well as a fun visual exploration in creating some modular people parts.

Starting in Adobe Illustrator I created variations on face shapes then moved onto changing background colors, finally adding some fun 8-bit theme sound effects and a save-to-png option.

Recently...
---------

* push to this repo
* update code to not look broken on retina screens
* update SVG assets with new sizes and colors
* revert retina fix (Despite using SVG, which is not natively supported in Phaser, the assets don't scale as cleanly as I'd like on Retina/high-dpi screens, so best viewed a normal 72dpi screen.)
